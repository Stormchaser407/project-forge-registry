# Project Forge Configuration Reference

This document describes the configuration schema for the Project Forge Registry system.

## Overview

Project Forge uses a YAML configuration file to define project storage locations, dashboard settings, scanning behavior, and safety policies. The configuration model is machine-agnostic and designed to be portable across different environments.

PyYAML is optional. If it is installed, Project Forge uses it for config parsing. If it is not installed, Project Forge falls back to a built-in stdlib parser that supports the repository's example-style config format without any package installs.

## Configuration File Locations

The system looks for configuration files in the following order:

1. `config/project_forge.yml` — Main configuration (can be committed)
2. `config/project_forge.local.yml` — Local overrides (should be git-ignored)
3. `project_forge.yml` — Root-level configuration
4. `~/.config/project-forge/config.yml` — User-level configuration

**Recommended setup:** Copy `config/project_forge.example.yml` to `config/project_forge.local.yml` and customize. The `.gitignore` file should include `config/project_forge.local.yml` to prevent committing sensitive paths.

## Schema Reference

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `projects_root` | string | Root directory for project storage. Supports `~` expansion. |
| `vault_project_root` | string | Root directory for Obsidian vault projects. Supports `~` expansion. |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `default_slug` | string | `null` | Default slug for new projects. |
| `editor_command` | string | `null` | Command to open the code editor (e.g., `code`, `nvim`). |
| `dashboard_host` | string | `127.0.0.1` | Host for the dashboard web server. |
| `dashboard_port` | integer | `8080` | Port for the dashboard web server (1-65535). |
| `theme` | string | `dark` | UI theme: `dark`, `light`, or `system`. |
| `scan_roots` | list[string] | `[]` | Directories to scan for projects. |
| `excluded_paths` | list[string] | `[]` | Paths to exclude from scanning. |
| `allow_apply` | boolean | `false` | Allow apply operations (currently rejected by policy). |
| `allow_push` | boolean | `false` | Allow push operations (currently rejected by policy). |

## Example Configuration

```yaml
# Required: Project Storage
projects_root: ~/Projects
vault_project_root: ~/main_vault/10 Projects

# Optional: Project Defaults
# default_slug: my-project
# editor_command: code

# Optional: Dashboard Settings
# dashboard_host: 127.0.0.1
# dashboard_port: 8080
# theme: dark

# Optional: Scanning Configuration
# scan_roots:
#   - ~/Projects
#   - ~/work
# excluded_paths:
#   - ~/Projects/archive

# Safety Policy (do not enable without explicit approval)
# allow_apply: false
# allow_push: false
```

## Parser Compatibility

The built-in fallback parser is intentionally limited to the Project Forge config shape. It supports:

- comments beginning with `#`
- blank lines
- simple `key: value` pairs
- quoted and unquoted strings
- integers
- booleans `true` and `false`
- `null`, `~`, and empty values
- simple list blocks such as `scan_roots` and `excluded_paths`

It does not aim to support full YAML features such as nested mappings, complex quoting rules, anchors, or multi-line scalars. Malformed input returns a clear config error instead of guessing.

## Validation Rules

### Required Field Validation

The configuration loader validates that `projects_root` and `vault_project_root` are present and non-empty. Missing required fields raise `ConfigValidationError`.

### Type Validation

- `dashboard_port` must be an integer between 1 and 65535.
- `theme` must be one of: `dark`, `light`, `system`.
- `scan_roots` and `excluded_paths` must be lists (non-list values are coerced to empty lists).

### Path Expansion

All path fields support `~` for home directory expansion. Paths are expanded when accessed via the `get_*` methods on the config object.

### Path Existence Validation

By default, paths are **not** required to exist. This allows configuration to be loaded on machines where certain directories may not yet be created. To enable path existence validation, pass `validate_paths=True` to the `ConfigLoader`.

## Safety Policy

### Restricted Operations

The following settings are **rejected** by the current safety policy:

- `allow_apply: true` — Raises `ConfigPolicyError`
- `allow_push: true` — Raises `ConfigPolicyError`

These features require explicit policy approval before they can be enabled. This is a deliberate safety mechanism to prevent accidental destructive operations.

### Exception Hierarchy

```
ConfigError (base)
├── ConfigValidationError — Missing/invalid configuration values
└── ConfigPolicyError — Safety policy violations
```

## Programmatic Usage

### Loading Configuration

```python
from project_forge_registry.config_model import load_config, ConfigLoader

# Convenience function
config = load_config("config/project_forge.local.yml")

# With path existence validation
config = load_config("config/project_forge.local.yml", validate_paths=True)

# Using ConfigLoader directly
loader = ConfigLoader(validate_paths=False)
config = loader.load("config/project_forge.local.yml")

# From a string (useful for testing)
config = loader.load_string(yaml_content)
```

No package installation is required for the example config format shown in this document.

### Accessing Configuration

```python
# Get expanded paths
projects_path = config.get_projects_root()  # Returns Path | None
vault_path = config.get_vault_project_root()  # Returns Path | None
scan_paths = config.get_scan_roots()  # Returns list[Path]
excluded = config.get_excluded_paths()  # Returns list[Path]

# Direct attribute access (raw strings)
print(config.projects_root)
print(config.dashboard_port)

# Convert to dictionary
config_dict = config.to_dict()
```

### Direct Instantiation

```python
from project_forge_registry.config_model import ProjectForgeConfig

config = ProjectForgeConfig(
    projects_root="/home/user/Projects",
    vault_project_root="/home/user/vault/Projects",
    dashboard_port=3000,
    theme="light",
)
```

## Local Configuration and Git

The file `config/project_forge.local.yml` should be added to `.gitignore` to prevent committing local paths and settings. The example file `config/project_forge.example.yml` is safe to commit and serves as a template.

Example `.gitignore` entry:

```gitignore
# Local Project Forge configuration
config/project_forge.local.yml
```
